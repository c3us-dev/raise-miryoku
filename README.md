# raise-miryoku
A slightly modified miryoku qwerty layout for use with the dygma raise. Shooting for the balance between the ergonomic customization provided by sensible virtual layers and "someone could use my keyboard at work real quick if they had to" accessibility with a familiar row-staggered base QWERTY layout.
